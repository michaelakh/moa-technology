          About Ozi
        </h1>
        <p>
          Hello there! My name is Ozi and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm very good with Front-end Web development, I prefer to make websites look professional and easy to use, instead of flashy and clunky, and I love clean professional well tested code which I use for both Back-end and Front-end web development  
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my journey as a self-taught web developer right out of University when I first discovered the biggest CMS in the industry, WordPress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since, I have fallen in love with web development and spend most of my days taking my craft to the next level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays I tend to code all of my projects from scratch in order to deliver a unique experience to every company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like many other people, I enjoy spending my free time increasing my knowledge of Web Development and building new and challenging projects.
        </p>
